# Animal-Simulator

This Project builds on my landscapes and mapmaker program.
It adds things like Finite State Machines for AI and an Entity Component System.
This was more of a learning process using what I learned in various classes in school. It is not meant to be a finished product.

Repository currently abandoned.
